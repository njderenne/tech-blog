# Tech Blog

## Application Description

This application is a responsive blog webpage used for the tech community. The user has the ability to sign up and log in. Once the user is logged in they can see other user blog posts as well as a dashboard where they can see the blog posts they have created. In the dashboard the user also can create new blog posts, edit a post they have already created or delete a created post. From the homepage or the user dashboard the user will have the ability to view all comments on a blog post and will be directed to a page with just a singular post where they can then add a new comment.
